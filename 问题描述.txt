Problem description
Each item is a box characterized by its weight and size.
Each type of container truck is characterized by a weight capacity and size 
(i.e., defined by length, width and height).
Given
• N pickup points, one starting point (i.e., parking lot), and one delivery point 
(i.e., port)
• distance between any two points
• K types of container trucks (e.g., 20HQ，40GP and 40HQ)
• a set of items in each pickup point that needs to be transported to the delivery 
point
Task
• given an order, the task is to arrange trucks to transport all items to the 
delivery point
Decision Variables
• n : the number of trucks
• the type of each truck
• route of each truck (i.e., the sequence of points visited by each truck)
• items loaded to each truck at each point
• packing scheme (i.e., three-dimensional coordinates of items) of each truck
Objective functions
• f1=1−∑ni=1loading_ratei/n ,
where loading_ratei=max(v_ratei,w_ratei) ,
v_ratei = the total volume of all the items in truck i / the size of the 
truck i ,
w_ratei = the total weight of all the items in truck i / the weight 
capacity of the truck i .
• f2=∑ni=1truck_distancei
where truck_distancei is the distance traveled by the truck i .
Constraints
This problem includes two types of constraints: vehicle routing and 3-D loading,
• valid route constraints: each route must start from the starting point and end 
at the delivery point
2
• bonded warehouse constraints: the bonded warehouse is a special pickup 
point that can only be visited by empty trucks. Hence, if a pickup point is 
marked as a bonded warehouse, it must be the first of any route that contains 
it
• single visit constraints: each truck can only visit each pickup point once
• none-overlapping constraints: items cannot overlap in any dimension
• none-splitting constraints: one item can only be loaded in one truck
• supporting constraints: the item must have sufficient supporting surface, i.e., 
the supporting area should be greater than 80% of the bottom area of the 
item
• weight capacity constraints: the total weight of the cargoes loaded on one 
truck cannot exceed the weight capacity of the truck
• size constraints: all the items must be loaded inside the container
• one-time loading constraints: once a truck leaves a pickup point, the 
items loaded at the pickup point cannot be moved anymore
